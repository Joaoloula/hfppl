LLaMPPL is a research prototype for language model probabilistic programming: specifying language generation tasks by writing probabilistic programs that combine calls to LLMs, symbolic program logic, and probabilistic conditioning. To solve these tasks, LLaMPPL uses a specialized sequential Monte Carlo inference algorithm. 

This technique, SMC steering, is described in our paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03081]().
